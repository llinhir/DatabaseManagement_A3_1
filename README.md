Setup instructions:
Choose a location in File Explorer for the cloned Github Repository to go.
Right click and open the location in terminal.
Use the command 'git clone https://github.com/llinhir/DatabaseManagement_A3_1.git'
Open pgAdmin and right click on Databases > Create > Database.
Name it and save, then right click on your new database and use Query Tool.
Find the option in the Query Tool you opened to Open File, and open the Assignment3Q1.sql file in the Github Repository you cloned earlier.
Run the file.
To test the functions, simply right click on the database again to make a new Query Tool and either write your own queries using the functions or use the ones I commented out at the bottom of my .sql file.
Thank you.
